# JS-QUIZ
This repo is about the Javascript fundamentals quiz that I learned in the past week, This challange is about a webpage that uses Javascript to do produce a quiz. The started code is  provided in the starter code. The html code is given in the starter code to make the page work.
My motivation for this project is to make sure the I have learned the stuff taugh in the lessons. To make this project a stepping stone on my journy to a frontend development. I build this project because I wanted to test what the knowledge that I gained from the bootcamp and apply it to a real world example.

It gives us an oppertunity to learn about javascript.

I learned how to use different attritibutes of Javascript like arrays, console.log etc.
